Our Phone Identity Network platform helps companies accelerate revenue, mitigate fraud, and reduce OPEX across channels and the value chain. \n\nOur solutions benefit all areas of the value chain where a consumer’s identity must be verified or authenticated, but are especially pertinent to the Marketing & Sales and Servicing components of the value chain. \n\nProve has two main solutions:\n\nProve Pre-fill™ for Onboarding & Digital Acquisition, which helps companies increase signups and mitigate account opening fraud by pre-filling authenticated data in any channel.\n\nFonebook™ for Digital Servicing, which helps companies manage customer phone numbers against changes, append additional phone numbers and other customer information, and access our Phone Identity Network registry of identity tokens to secure transactions across multiple digital servicing use cases including login, high-risk transactions, call center, and passwordless login.\n\nOne of the most unique benefits of our solutions is that they leverage our Phone Identity Network™ (PIN), which is a registry of 1 billion+ identity tokens under continuous management. Our clients can associate customer IDs to the corresponding identity tokens, and can access these identity tokens across the customer journey and value chain. PIN is informed by multiple data sources including telecom, bank & public, and 10+ years of proprietary Prove data. \n\n",
